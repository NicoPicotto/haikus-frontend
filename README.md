This is a **starter template** for building React applications using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/) (a UI library built on Tailwind CSS). It provides a modern development environment with sensible defaults to kickstart your projects.

## ✨ Features

-  **⚡ Fast Development**: Powered by Vite for blazing-fast builds and live reloading.
-  **🎨 Beautiful UI**: Pre-configured with Shadcn components and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
-  **📚 TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
-  **🌗 Theme Toggle**: Built-in light/dark mode toggle for your applications.
-  **🔌 Extensible**: Easily add new dependencies or configurations as needed.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a clean and intuitive folder structure:

## 🛠️ Customization

### Shadcn Components

All Shadcn components are located in the `src/components/ui` folder. You can customize them or add new ones using the [Shadcn documentation](https://shadcn.dev/).

### Tailwind Configuration

The Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is pre-configured but can be extended to suit your project’s design system.

## 🌗 Built-in Theme Toggle

This starter includes a theme toggle button (light, dark, and system modes). You can find the implementation in the `src/components/mode-toggle.tsx` file. Adjust or extend it to fit your requirements.
